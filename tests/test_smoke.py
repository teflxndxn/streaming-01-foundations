"""tests/test_smoke.py - Smoke test for the example.

WHY: Professional Python projects include tests to verify that code runs
     correctly and to catch problems early when changes are made.
     Running tests is part of the standard workflow in every module.

OBS: You do not need to read or modify this file in Module 1.
     It exists so that `uv run python -m pytest` passes on a clean project.
